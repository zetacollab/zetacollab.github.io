# React Portfolio (Vite) + GitHub Pages (Actions)

## Quick start
1) Create a repo (recommended: `zetacollab.github.io` for a user site).
2) Copy these files into the repo.
3) Repo Settings → Pages → Source: **GitHub Actions**.
4) Push to `main` → Actions builds and deploys.

## Notes
- If you deploy as a project site (repo name is NOT `username.github.io`), set `BASE_PATH` in the workflow
  to `/<repo-name>/`.
